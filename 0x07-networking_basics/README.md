# Networking Basics #0

A collection of scripts and resources focusing on fundamental networking concepts.

## Overview

This project covers essential networking topics including:
- OSI Model
- LAN, WLAN, and Internet infrastructure
- IP addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
- TCP/UDP protocols
- Common ports and services
- Network diagnostic tools

## Core Concepts

### OSI Model
The [OSI Model](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/OSI) (Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual framework used to understand network interactions in seven layers.

### Network Types
- LAN (Local Area Network)
- WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network)
- Internet (Global network of networks)

### Protocols & Addressing
- **IP Addresses**: IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes
- **TCP** (Transmission Control Protocol)
- **UDP** (User Datagram Protocol)

### Common Ports
- SSH: 22
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443

### Network Tools
- **ping**: Protocol used to verify device network connectivity
- **netstat**: Utility to display network connections and listening ports

## Project Files

### 4-TCP_and_UDP_ports
Bash script that displays actively listening sockets and their associated PIDs.

### 5-is_the_host_on_the_network
Bash script that pings an IP address (passed as an argument) 5 times.

## Technical Environment

- **Programming Language**: Bash scripts (files #4-5)
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
